About bootstrap in Moodle
-------------------------
If you want to make changes to the .css generated from these .less files then you
need to use a LESS Compiler. Details on specific compilers and how to install them
can be found at http://docs.moodle.org/dev/LESS

At present, recess is the official tool for developers to compile LESS into CSS, as
other tools give different results in the generated CSS.

Once recess has been installed you can compile and compress the LESS into CSS using
the following commands from the "theme/eclass/less" directory:

For the main Moodle styles:

    recess --compile --compress eclass.less > ../style/eclass.css

And for the subset of styles of interest to the TinyMCE editor:

    recess --compile --compress editor.less >  ../style/editor.css

You can add --watch to make sure it updates every time you make a change.

If the compilation is failing and you're not getting any useful error message, try using lessc instead i.e.:

    lessc eclass.less

This is the same tool that's getting called by recess, but the errors seems better if you go direct.

The compiled css files are not checked in to the git repository.  They are
created at deployment time.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If your compiled css files are empty, recess is not installed correctly.
Purge the recess you have installed, and reinstall using
    npm install -g recess
