This statement describes the purpose and procedures of the study. Also described is your right to withdraw from the study at any time. This study has been approved by the Research Ethics Board of the University of Alberta on May 8th, 2015, ID # is Pro00056706</p>"
        . "<h3>Explanation of Procedures:</h3><p>This research project is designed to study the feasibility of the assessment model (GAAT) that we have developed among students. Since this study will lead to a campus wide use of the GAAT, we are conducting this study to learn more about the assessment of graduate attributes. This has been, since the beginning, a student driven project and your participation in this study will provide important insight to the Students' Union and VP Academic for decision making.</p>"
        . "<h4>Participation in the study involves:</h4><p>(1) completion of a survey that asks you basic questions about yourself, your program of study, etc.</p><p>(2) online self-assessments of the Graduate attributes in the GAAT platform, which will take approximately 10 to 15 minutes and will be conducted each semester for the next two years</p><p>(3) if you want, a completion of a user's feedback section at the end of the study</p>"
        . "<h3>Benefits:</h3><p>The Graduate Attributes (GAs) has been a student-driven initiative since 2007. This project aims to extend this initiative by piloting the GAAT amongst students who will provide valuable insight into the actual assessment of the GAs by students and for students. Data from this study will contribute to decision-making by the Provost's office in using the GAAT campus-wide.</p>"

Only the researchers will have access to the study data and information. There will not be any identifying names on the surveys; all data will be kept confidential. Your names and any other identifying details will never be revealed in any publication of the results of this study. The results of the research will be published in the form of a research paper and may be published in a professional journal or presented at professional meetings. It may also be published in book form. The knowledge obtained from this study will be of great value in guiding assessment of competencies in higher education.</p>"
